# 🏏 IPL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores the **Indian Premier League (IPL)** dataset to analyze teams, players, and match outcomes using Python.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Team performance trends across seasons  
- Top batsmen & bowlers statistics  
- Toss decisions & match-winning factors

## 📊 Data Sources
The project is based on **two official IPL datasets**, merged using the `id` column to create a comprehensive DataFrame:

1. **Matches Dataset (`matches_df.csv`)** – Match-level information  
2. **Balls Dataset (`balls_df.csv`)** – Ball-by-ball details  

## 🚀 Steps
1. Data cleaning & preprocessing  
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. Visualizations for insights

## ▶️ How to Run This Project
To explore this analysis on your local system or Google Colab:

1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Ensure required libraries are installed:
